        We are team who started real small and who grew up around families who
        love to bake. As time passed we got fully equipped with family recipes
        that got passed down from previous generations and finally decided to
        come together and put it to good use. We started a baking business using
        tools from home and started producing cake aswell as other baked goods.
        However we struggled to get customers and businesses to buy our goods.

          margin-left: auto;
          margin-right: auto;
        "
      />
      <p>
        We decided to then take our business on the road , not knowing that this
        would be the turning point of our bakery business. This is what we did
        to please the customers that we had and it got our business up and
        running better than ever.

      Today we own our own modern bakery. We also host everything from social
      and business events to small intimate weddings and functions. When we
      initially started our business , we never thought we would become this
      big.
